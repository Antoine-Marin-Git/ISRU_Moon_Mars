Overview
========

This work aims to provide models for the extraction and the processing of lunar/martian soil and martian atmosphere for the in-situ production of propellant and 
essential resources for the crew and infrastructures (O2/H2O).
Three main processes have been studies for regolith processing (lunar soil):

- Hydrogene reduction of Ilmenite
- Carbothermal reduction of Silica
- Drying of wet regolith/ice in Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR)



The extraction phase must be taken into account
